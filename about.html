                            <p> Confucianism originated in ancient 6th century China and was formed by the Chinese philosopher Confusious who lived from (551- 479BCE), the founder of Confucianism is Confusius. Confucius was seen as a leader and transmitter of cultural beliefs that extended from the Xia, Shang, Zhou dynasties, and was seen as the founder of Confucianism, hence its name, and expressed his view on the way of life. During his early years as a political leader, he expressed his belief that one could live a happier and more fulfilling life by doing right instead of wrong in terms of a moral code and could render a more effective and peaceful goverment and society, as during these times, China was in a warring state period during the  Zhou Dynasty , and Confucius had a goal to end this period of corruption, evil and dishonor among families, communities, and governmental systems and did so through his beliefs, words and values, and  so, he resigned from his position and left the state of Lu. Confucianism sprouted from the religion of Buddhism and Taoism, and was able to spread its influence with holding some similarities with Buddhism, and spreading his views with students and fellow philosophers he interacted with. Confucianism revolved around confucius views and beliefs on the way a successful and rich full government, community and life must be lived and how it can be obtained through ethics and moral values at no worship for a god, but through self effort.

                            <p>
                                   <h3> Confucianism held two field of beliefs, the first five listed below, are beliefs and values everyone regardless of how invested they are into Confucianism must live life by.</h3>
                                <p>
                                    &#8226; Integrity, righteousness, altruism, goodness, and loyalty is something everyone should hold. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        &#8226; Rulers should rule by virtue and moral teachings rather than by punishment, cruelty or force
                                        </p>
                                <p> &#8226;  No one should assume authority based on their class, priority in society is earned through character and hard work. </p>
                           <p>   &#8226; Wealth and rank should be given to those who study and strive to be good and kind, not only to benefit their personal lives, but society (One can go from rags to riches)
                        <p> 
                            &#8226; Treat everyone and everything with kindness and respect
                            </p>

                            <h3>The following are principles and values that those more invested into Confucianism abide by known as the Li, Yi, Ren, that promote morals and peace</h3>
                        </p>
                           
                        <p> &#8226; As you may remember, Buddhism held a state by which only very few could obtain, this state being Nirvana, which resembled one's fulfillment and purity, the same aspect applies in Confucianism, only that the state that is sought to obtain is known as Ren, and is obtained through harmony of Li, Yi, and Ren.</p>
                        <br> 
                        <h4>Ren:</h4> 
                        <p>Ren is a state of being pure and one with self, community and spirit and live in a state of harmony and high morality and is only obtained if one's Yi and Li are aligned. Ren makes everyone unique as everyone will have diffrent walks in life and experiences, and will have diffrent forms of enacting Li and Yi. Ren is the mark of one being a good person in society.</p>
                           
                            </p>
<br>
                            <h4>Li:</h4> 
                            <p>The ritual and mundane actions one makes during their life and its effects on their community, goverment, family, and self, based on routines. A amazing example would be respecting your elders and those of higher authority.</p>
                               
                                </p>
<br>




<h4>Yi:</h4> 
<p>One holds the sense and knowledge to tell right from wrong and goes about life taking the actions that are right.</p>
   
    </p>
                     
    <br>
<h4>Refresher:</h4> 
<p>Ren is the state of being a pure and good member of society and life, Li are the actions an individual makes to achieve Ren, and Yi are the thoghts of choosing what is right from wrong. Those of Confusiunism practice believe that by achieving harmony and Ren, an individual can posess dignity and respect that changes the course of their life</p>

                                Confucianism does not have a set of specific Festivals or holidays, holidays mostly include those created by other religions such as chinese new year, as Confucianism does not hold a god and has no need for a virtue of a god. Those of Confucianism affiliation do however celebrate a handful of holidays that they made to honor Confucius, his beliefs, values, and events throughout his life, as he highly encouraged celebrations amoung individuals for better comradery and connection.

    <a href="#">Similarities to the Eastern Religions</a>
    
<p>Confucianism is a religion that originated in the Eastern side of the world like many Eastern religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism.</p>   
<p>At a vast spectrum, Eastern religions condemn to be polythestic and hold multiple gods with distinct roles, in which Confucianism does not hold virtue to any god, and it could be said that it is Atheist in a form. Confucianism and Eastern religions hold more differences than similarities, but to touch base on the similarities, Confucianism and Eastern religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism hold beliefs around reaching the purest form of life, with Buddhism holding Nirvana, Hinduism holding one's soul becoming pure and one with Rahmen and Confucianism being reaching a state of Ren. </p>  
<p> In addition to the ideal form of one, Confucianism and Eastern religions also share the fact that they are non binary and hold no set of morals and values that prevent any individual from practicing the religion. In addition, Confucianism and Eastern religions are philosophical religions, that show a way one should live their life and how a successful life can be obtained, while also believing in death and heaven. Confusinsm and eastern religions also hold a set of sacred beliefs and actions that they follow to obtain the ideal spot in life, such as Confucianism holding The Five Classics and The Four Books, hinduism holding the Dharma and Buddhism holding the Eightfold path. Confucianism and Eastern religions were holistic and held a open doctrine.</p>

                            <p>
                             <p>Confucianism holds factors that familiarize with those of Western Religions such as christianity. To begin with, both Confucianism and Christianity believe in the existence of the afterlife in heaven if one follows the values and beliefs held by their religion, although Confucianism is not Monthenistc and resonates more with Atheism in terms of worship of a god. </p>
                        
                           
                            <p>Although Christianity Judiasm, and Islam held Rigid Doctrines, Confusianism did not, but they both had a set of scripts that they based their beliefs, life and practices by. 
                                Those of Western civilizations abided by the bible, while those of Confucianism abided by The Five Classics and The Four Books, which held the teaching on the ways of life as descriptive by Confucius. Both founders and symbols of the religion of Confucianism and of the Western religions held a similar message in their golden rule, being not doing to others what you don't want to be done to you, and also a surrounding belief in the divergence of one's social class in life. 
                               </p>

<p>
    Confusiansm and Western religions have some beliefs and rules in life and the after life, but differ in their beliefs of ruler, as Confucianism did not believe in gods or messiahs and saw that individuals get out of life exactly what they put into it, and by following Confucius laws, beliefs and guidance, they could seek heaven.

                            <p>
                             <p>Confucianism has had a major impact on society and culture. The impact of Confucianism could be seen in the times of ancient China in which rulers ruled through force and cruelty, it was not until confucius thoughts and beliefs on leadership and life began to be accepted by governments that societies in China began to prosper. 
                            </p>
                        
                           
                            <p>In addition to having effects on ancient china society, it has also given individuals of any background of the world to practice Confucianism and have the wise words and teachings of Confucius without having to do any prerequisite like that circumcision that is held by thos of Judiasm practice, and have the freedom to follow the course of their life based on Confucius words, and are free to to resign from Confucianism at any moment. 
                               </p>

<p>
  
Confucianism set a form of beliefs and systems for governments, communities and individuals and has set world wide values that are seen in other religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism and Christianity. Lastly, Confucianism gives an opportunity to Atheist to see Confucianism as a way of living rather than a religion, as it does not hold a god.
